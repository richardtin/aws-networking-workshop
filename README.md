**AWS Networking Workshop**
--------------------

More and more customers have been migrating their production workloads from on-premises into AWS cloud. But in the mean time, it's a huge challenge on how to connect tens or hundreds of VPC together and still have ability to control routing. Otherwise, how to build a hybrid DNS architecture to allow all workloads communicating each other through DNS is a complicated question as well.

The objective of this workshop is to take you to build a hybrid architecture step by step by using three new AWS networking services AWS Transit Gateway, AWS Client VPN and Route53 Resolver. In the workshop, we will create 3 VPCs, 2 of them are spoke VPC and the other is shared service VPC where we will create AWS managed Microsoft Directory, AWS Client VPN endpoints and DNS service.The diagram below is the high level architecture we will build in this workshop.

**STEP 1 - Create VPCs**
---------------------------

For avoiding misconfiguration, we will automatically create the 3 VPCs by using CloudFormation. Copy the link below and specify the path as an template URL. 

<https://s3.amazonaws.com/ykwang-networking-workshop/create3vpc.yaml>

1) Choose **Creat new stack** on the CloudFormation page.
 
![Deployment Diagram](images/newstack.jpg)

2) Past the link under **Specify an Amazon S3 template URL** and click **Next**

![Deployment Diagram](images/templateurl.jpg)

3) Specify a stack name and click **Next**

![Deployment Diagram](images/stackname.jpg)

4) Click **Next** to skip **Option** page and click **Create** on **Review** page. CloudFormation will automatically create the VPCs and related resources. Wait 15 ~ 20 minutes and make sure the status is **CREATE_COMPLETE**

5) On VPC dashboard, there are 3 VPCs (VPC4VPN, VPC10 and VPC20) created by ClouFormation, and check the name and IPv4 CIDR of subnets that are the same with the screenshot below.

**Logical Components**

1) Cloud providers - BIG-IP Cloud Edition supports deployment and auto scale of BIG-IP instances on the following cloud platforms:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
 
* VMware vCenter-based private clouds

2) Device templates - Device templates define all infrastructure-level characteristics (time zone, DNS, hostname, accounts, NTP, licensing, networking, etc.) that are required to deploy a BIG-IP device.

3) Service scaling groups (SSG) - When application services are deployed from an application template and a service scaling group is selected as the target, BIG-IP Cloud Edition manages the availability and elastic scaling of resources to deliver the services, plus manages the lifecycle and upgrade process for the BIG-IP devices delivering those services.

4) Application templates - Application templates define the application delivery and security services that will be deployed for an application, including all BIG-IP objects such as virtual servers, profiles, monitors, SSL certificates, security policies, etc.

**Deployment Process**

To start auto-scaling BIG-IP VE devices for application in AWS, you need to complete these procedures.

* Step 1. Set up AWS environment

* Step 2. Create device template for BIG-IP VE

* Step 3. Add cloud and environment to BIG-IQ

* Step 4. Create a service scaling group

* Step 5. Create service template

* Step 6. Addign permissions to users (option)

* Step 7. Create and deploy an application


**Deploy BIG-IP Cloud Edition in AWS**
----------------------------------------------
Customers can deploy BIG-IP Cloud Edition from scratch in AWS through subscribing F5 software appliances on AWS marketplace or use BIG-IP Cloud Edition Trial Quick Start which is an AWS CloudFormation Template (CFT) created by F5 to allow customers to experience the solution in an automation way. 
In order to reduce human errors and minimize the time to deploy, we will use CloudFormation template as example to explain each step in the later chatper. 


**BIG-IP Cloud Edition Trial Quick Start**

To deploy the BIG-IP Cloud Edition Trial Quick Start in AWS, check the link below.
<https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-big-ip-cloud-edition-trial-quick-start>

This CloudFormation Template (CFT) creates two BIG-IQ VE instances: a BIG-IQ CM instance to configure and orchestrate instances of BIG-IP VE, and a BIG-IQ Data Collection Device (DCD) to store analytics data. The CFT also creates an Apache demo web server.
Enter the service page of CloudFormation and verify the bigiqCmUrl showed on the Outputs tab.

![Deployment Diagram](images/cloudformation.png)

SSH to BIG-IQ VE instance and create an admin user password for web access.

![Deployment Diagram](images/bigiqcm-ssh.jpg)

	1. Type "modify auth password admin"
	2. Type new password
	3. Confirm new password
	4. Type "save sys config"
	
![Deployment Diagram](images/bigiqchangepwd.jpg)

Open BIG-IQ login page and enter username as "admin", password as you typed above.

**Configuration**
--------------------------------------

**Step 1. Set up AWS environment**

The full access permissions you need to be granted are Auto Scale Groups, Instances, SQS, S3, CloudWatch, and CloudFormation. Additionally, you need list, create, and delete permissions for the IAM role/rolePolicy/InstanceProfile.

1) VPC Configurations

* Create VPC with 2 subnets in different AZs and unique CIDR
* Create Internet gateway and attach it to VPC
* Create route table for each subnet with default route
	
2) Create a key pair to allow SSH access

3) Create a security group to protect the elastic load balancer

4) Create a classic elastic load balancer (ELB) as tier1 service scaler to distribute requests from Internet to BIG-IP VE of SSG.

	1. ELB Type: Classic Load Balancer
	2. Health Checks: 
       * Ping protocol:TCP
       * Ping port: 22
       * Timeout: 5 seconds
       * Interval: 30 seconds
	3. EC2 Instances: Enabled Cross-Zone Load Balancing and Connection Draining at 300 seconds.
	4. Edit the ELB listeners to remove the default listener (Load Balancer Protocol and Instance Protocol of HTTP on port 80).

**Step 2. Create device template for BIG-IP VE**

1) At BIG-IQ page, click **Devices** then, on the left, click **DEVICE TEMPLATES**.

2) Click **Create** button.

3) Name the template, click **Add/Remove** button and select AWS as "Provider Type".

**Step 4. Create a service scaling group**

1) Click **Applications** > **ENVIRONMENT** > **Service Scaling Groups** > click **Create** button

2) Type the name and description. Select **Cloud Environment** you craeted in Step 3. 

3) Type the minimum and maximum number of BIG-IP VE you want running

4) Define the **Scale-Out** and **Scale-In** policy

5) Leave the cooldown period as default 15 minutes

![Deployment Diagram](images/ssg.jpg)

**Step 5. Create service template** 

1) Click **Applications** > **SERVICE CATALOG** > clone default template **Default-AWS-f5-HTTPS-WAF-lb-template**

2) Name your service template

3) Click service template name you just created

4) Keep **PROPERTIES** as default, you can configure each object under **LOCAL TRAFFIC**. We will configure **Virtual Servers** to demostrate how service template works.

5) Click **Virtual Servers** > click the name of virtial server template (ex: Demo-AWS-HTTPS-WAF-LTM_default_vs).

![Deployment Diagram](images/vs-template.jpg)

_Note: A Service Template is a baseline for creating a new application. This allows you to maintain a consistent environment. Parameters that you define as editable are visible and can be revised. Using that template, and without having a lot of network expertise, the application manager can deploy the application objects you want by simply specifying a few key values._

6) Check **Editable** box in the right hand side of **Description** and **State(on BIG-IQ)**. Click the **Preview** in the upper right corner to see what the user interface look like when someone uses this template to deploy an application. You can also configure **Pools**, **Nodes**, etc. but we will keep it as default.

![Deployment Diagram](images/vs-preview.jpg)

**Step 6. Addign permissions to users (option)**

1) Click **System** > **USER MANAGEMENT** > **Users**, click **Add** button.

2) Select **Auth Provider** as local, type **User name**, **Full Name**, **Password** and **Confirm Password**. Click **Save&Close**.

3) Click **ROLE MANAGEMENT** > **Roles** > **CUSTOM ROLES** > **Application Roles** > **Add**

4) Type **Name** and **Description**, select the user you want to join to this role. Select **Templates** and **Service Scaling Group** you want this role access to.

5) Click **Save&Close**
